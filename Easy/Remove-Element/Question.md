27. **Remove Element**

Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.<br>

Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:<br>
Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.<br>
Return k.<br>

Custom Judge:<br>
The judge will test your solution with the following code:<br>
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array<br>
int val = ...; // Value to remove<br>
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.<br>
// It is sorted with no values equaling val.<br>
int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation<br>
assert k == expectedNums.length;<br>
sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums<br>
for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {<br>
assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];<br>
}<br>
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.<br>

Example 1:<br>
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3<br>
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]<br>
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.<br>
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).<br>

Example 2:<br>
Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2<br>
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]<br>
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.<br>
Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.<br>
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).<br>

Constraints:<br>
0 <= nums.length <= 100<br>
0 <= nums[i] <= 50<br>
0 <= val <= 100
