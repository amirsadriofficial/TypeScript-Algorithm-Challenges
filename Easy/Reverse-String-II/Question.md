541. **Reverse String II**

Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.<br>

If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and leave the other as original.<br>

Example 1:<br>
Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2<br>
Output: "bacdfeg"<br>

Example 2:<br>
Input: s = "abcd", k = 2<br>
Output: "bacd"<br>

Constraints:<br>
1 <= s.length <= 104<br>
s consists of only lowercase English letters.<br>
1 <= k <= 104
