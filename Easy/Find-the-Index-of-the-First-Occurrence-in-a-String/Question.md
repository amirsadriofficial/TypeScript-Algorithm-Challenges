28. **Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String**

Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>
Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"<br>
Output: 0<br>
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.<br>
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.<br>
Example 2:<br>
Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"<br>
Output: -1<br>
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.<br>

Constraints:<br>
1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104<br>
haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.
