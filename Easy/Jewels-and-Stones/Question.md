771. **Jewels and Stones**

You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.<br>

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".<br>

Example 1:<br>
Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"<br>
Output: 3<br>

Example 2:<br>
Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"<br>
Output: 0<br>

Constraints:<br>
1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50<br>
jewels and stones consist of only English letters.<br>
All the characters of jewels are unique.
