9. **Palindrome Number**

Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.<br>

Example 1:<br>
Input: x = 121<br>
Output: true<br>
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.<br>

Example 2:<br>
Input: x = -121<br>
Output: false<br>
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.<br>

Example 3:<br>
Input: x = 10<br>
Output: false<br>
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.<br>

Constraints:<br>
-231 <= x <= 231 - 1
