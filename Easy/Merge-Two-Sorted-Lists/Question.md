21. **Merge Two Sorted Lists**

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.<br>

Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.<br>

Return the head of the merged linked list.<br>
 

Example 1:<br>
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]<br>
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]<br>

Example 2:<br>
Input: list1 = [], list2 = []<br>
Output: []<br>

Example 3:<br>
Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]<br>
Output: [0]<br>

Constraints:<br>
The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].<br>
-100 <= Node.val <= 100<br>
Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
