268. **Missing Number**

Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.<br>

Example 1:<br>
Input: nums = [3,0,1]<br>
Output: 2<br>
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.<br>

Example 2:<br>
Input: nums = [0,1]<br>
Output: 2<br>
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.<br>

Example 3:<br>
Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]<br>
Output: 8<br>
Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.<br>

Constraints:<br>
n == nums.length<br>
1 <= n <= 104<br>
0 <= nums[i] <= n<br>
All the numbers of nums are unique.
