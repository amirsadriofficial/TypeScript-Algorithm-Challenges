205. **Isomorphic Strings**

Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.<br>

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.<br>

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.<br>

Example 1:<br>
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"<br>
Output: true<br>

Example 2:<br>
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"<br>
Output: false<br>

Example 3:<br>
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"<br>
Output: true<br>

Constraints:<br>
1 <= s.length <= 5 \* 104<br>
t.length == s.length<br>
s and t consist of any valid ascii character.
