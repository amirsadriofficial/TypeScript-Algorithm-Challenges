287. **Find the Duplicate Number**

Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.<br>

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.<br>

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.<br>

 

Example 1:<br>
Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]<br>
Output: 2<br>

Example 2:<br>
Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]<br>
Output: 3<br>

Example 3:<br>
Input: nums = [3,3,3,3,3]<br>
Output: 3<br>

Constraints:<br>
1 <= n <= 105<br>
nums.length == n + 1<br>
1 <= nums[i] <= n<br>
All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.<br>

Follow up:<br>
How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in nums?<br>
Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?
