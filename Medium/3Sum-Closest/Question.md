16. 3Sum Closest<br>

Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.<br>

Return the sum of the three integers.<br>

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.<br>

Example 1:<br>
Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1<br>
Output: 2<br>
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).<br>

Example 2:<br>
Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 1<br>
Output: 0<br>
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0).<br>

Constraints:<br>
3 <= nums.length <= 500<br>
-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000<br>
-104 <= target <= 104
