3. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.<br>

Example 1:<br>
Input: s = "abcabcbb"<br>
Output: 3<br>
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.<br>

Example 2:<br>
Input: s = "bbbbb"<br>
Output: 1<br>
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.<br>

Example 3:<br>
Input: s = "pwwkew"<br>
Output: 3<br>
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.<br>
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.<br>

Constraints:<br>
0 <= s.length <= 5 \* 104<br>
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
